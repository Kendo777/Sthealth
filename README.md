There is a genre of games in which the objective is to infiltrate in an enemy area
without being caught. This genre is usually referred as stealth or espionage
games. Usually we find this type of game merged with other genres like combat
or platform. In this practice you will need to create some of the mechanics of a
stealth game.

Some examples of the games featuring stealth are Commandos or Metal Gear
Solid (or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqp1z-hkVgo ). In these games,
the area of detection of enemies is sometimes depicted as triangular areas or
portions of a circle
